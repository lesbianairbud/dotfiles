# Window Rules

# Let me tell you one thing. I don't know who did this to you and I don't know why you feel like this but I want you to know one thing. No one and I mean no one should ever feel any sort of resentment towards you simply for having boundaries and things you like or don't like to do. Anyone who does that is automatically a bad person in my opinion
# I have never felt any form of resentment or hatred towards you simply for not being okay with seeing, hearing or experiencing certain things and I can promise you that I never will. They're your boundaries and no matter how absurd anyone thinks they are I think you have all the right to stablish them and mantain them
# You are not hurting anyone by just saying no. And if you are then that is most likely a serious subject that needs to be treated carefully but even in those rare extreme cases (This isn't one of those) You should never make yourself feel uncomfortable and or let alone at risk just to please someone else. Please Ivory
# Have a bit of self respect you're an amazing person and I hope you're able to realize how much you matter and how loved you are. I don't know why you think like this I don't know who hurt you but I want you to know that it's over and that I will never judge you like that, I will always be there for you. I love you Ivory please take care and g'night <3
